DUMMY WINDOWS EXECUTABLE
========================

This is a placeholder file for the Windows enumeration script.
In production, this would be an actual .exe file that:

1. Collects installed applications
2. Gathers network configuration
3. Gets MAC address and system info
4. POSTs data back to the server at /api/help-download/postData

Replace this file with the actual compiled Windows executable.
